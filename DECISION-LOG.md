# Decision Log — Bluegrass Advisory Group Website

## 2026-03-01: Website restructured for scannability + SEO

**What changed:**
- Homepage trimmed from 9 long-form sections to 4 scannable sections (hero, 3 cards, credibility bar, audience, CTA)
- Services page now shows transparent pricing (Discovery $500-1K, Roadmap+Build $2.5K, Dashboard $3-5K)
- About page trimmed, added three-layer moat section
- Created Insights page with featured article and 3 placeholder upcoming posts
- Added SEO fundamentals: sitemap.xml, robots.txt, structured data JSON-LD, canonical URLs, Open Graph tags
- Added GA4 placeholder (needs real measurement ID)
- Added vercel.json with cleanUrls for pretty URL routing
- Nav updated across all pages: Home | Services | About | Insights | Contact

**Why:**
- Google had ZERO pages indexed — site was invisible to search engines
- Homepage was too wordy — visitors bounced before understanding what BAG does
- Pricing transparency pre-qualifies prospects and builds trust
- Insights page creates an SEO magnet for business owners searching for AI operations content

**Pricing decision:**
- Chose to display pricing publicly. Business owners appreciate knowing costs upfront. It filters out unqualified leads and builds credibility.
